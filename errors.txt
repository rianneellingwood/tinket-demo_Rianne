/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
 
  This example code is in the public domain.

// Pin  has an LED connected on most Arduino boards.
// give it a name:
int led = ;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup                
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(led, INPUT);     
}

// the loop routine runs over and over:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, 8);   // turn the LED on ( is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, 8);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage 
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
